>   1. Naming Variables
>       When naming variables, it's important to use clear, memorable, and understandable names that describes what the variable stores. Always use camelCase so that it's easy to read and consistent. You can start variable names with a letter or an underscore, but never use numbers, other special characters, or reserved keywords since those will cause errors in your code. Lastly, don't make your variable names too long, make it short and simple so that its easy to type and remember.
