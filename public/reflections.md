## List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with three to five sentences.
>   1. Naming Variables - When naming variables, it's important to use clear, memorable, and understandable names that describes what the variable stores. Always use camelCase, where the variable name starts with a lowercase letter and every new word after that begins with a capital letter, so that it's easy to read and consistent. You can start variable names with a letter, underscore, or dollar sign, but never start with numbers, other special characters, or reserved keywords since those will cause errors in your code. Lastly, don't make your variable names too long, make it short and simple so that its easy to type and remember.
>   2. Data Types - There are six primitive (fundamental) data types: strings, numbers, Boolean, null, undefined, and symbol. Strings are for text, you can either use double or single quotation marks. Numbers are for numerical values, you don't need to put it in quotes since it would become a character in string, numbers can be a decimal (float), whole, positive, negative, and can be up to 15 digits. Boolean is either a true or false value. Undefined has no value, null is a value that represents nothing, and symbol could be unique and unchanging. 
>   3. JavaScript Operations - There are four different types of operators: arithmetic operators, comparison operators, logical operators, and assignment operators. Arithmetic operators like +, -, *, /, and % can be used when doing math calculations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, remainder, or exponents. Comparison operators like ==, ===, !=, !==, >, <, >= and <= can be used when checking equality or comparing values. Logical operators like &&, ||, and ! can be used when combining conditions or reversing values. Assignment operators like =, +=, -=, *=, /=, and %= can be used when assigning values or updating them in a shorter way.
>   4. Conditional Statements - Conditional Statements like if, else if, else is a way to make decisions in your code. It allows a code to run only if the certain condition is met, and do something else if the condition is not met. You can use the conditional statement if when you want a code to run only if a certain condition is met. You can use the conditional statement else if when you want one code to run if the condition is true and another code if the condition is false. You can use the conditional statement else when you need to check multiple conditions one after the other.  
>   5. Switch Statements - A switch statement is also considered a conditional statement. A switch statement is used to check one value against many other options. Each case is one possible answer, and if the expression matches, the code for that case will run. The break stops the program from checking the other cases once the right one is matched. If none of the cases match, the default will run. Instead of writing a long chain of if, else if, and else, you can use switch to make the code more simpler and easier to read.
## List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why. The why should be per topic listed.
