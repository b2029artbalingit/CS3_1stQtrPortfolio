* President BongBong Marcos said that the number of jobs have increased, but he didnâ€™t explain what kind of jobs they added or how they help people earn enough for a decent living. It sounded unclear.

3. Write 2 paragraphs of reflection (each paragraph is ideally around 4 sentences)
	The SONA 2025 showed that while the government has made efforts in some sectors like healthcare, education, and infrastructure, there are still many issues in other sectors that need to be addressed. Such issues include expensive medicine, lack of doctors, and poverty are still present in many communities. These issues remind us that real progress requires time and consistent action. It shows that the government must work harder to reach the people who are struggling in far and poor areas.

	However, progress is not entirely dependent on the government. As citizens of the Philippines, we also have a role in helping our country improve. It needs its citizens to contribute in solving the issues that our country is facing. Together, we can overcome the challenges and make the Philippines truly progress and move forward.

4. What 1 word/ phrase/ or sentence do you have for the Philippines after hearing SONA 2025?
